# Maps

# Maps are a collection of key-value pairs.

# Their keys can be strings, numbers, or any other type.
# The values can be any type, including other maps or lists.
# The keys must be unique within the map.
# # Maps are useful for storing structured data, such as user profiles, configuration settings, or any other data that can be represented as key-value pairs.
# Maps are defined using curly braces `{}` and can be nested.
# Users can be accessed using the `each.key` and `each.value` syntax in a `for_each` loop.
# this is useful for creating resources dynamically based on the map's contents.
